# Hello **{{ login }}**!
If you've reached this page, that means that you've effictively been phished. Well, not exactly.  
I haven't taken any data from you. But if I was a malicious hacker, you may have entered your login information on the next page, and that wouldn't have been great.  
## Wait, what?
Yup, you never actually hit the cantina website. The email that linked you here was not sent by Lou.  
This is all part of a phishing awareness campaign that is being launched for 42.  
## What did I miss?
- The email was sent via sendgrid instead of online.net.  
- The link in the email had a different text than the link, causing it to refer to a different site.  
- The URL is not cantina.42.us.org, instead it is 42find.me.  
- The website is not using SSL  

## Why is this important?
As we enter the world of programming, we open ourselves up to targeted attacks.  
According to Wombat Security, 85% of organizations reported that they had suffered from phishing attacks.  
These attacks can cost more than personal information. They are frequently used to expose and steal company secrets.  
## What should I do?
What should be done varies depending on who you are. This campaign is being ran on cadets, staff, and those in the piscine.  

### Staff and Cadets
Take some time to read about phishing prevention.

### Pisciners
Don't worry too much about this, I just wanted to give you a taste of some of the things us students are working on.  
Stay focused on the piscine!  

## Who are you?
Hi, I'm Matt Hurd (intra name mhurd). After hearing some rumors of phishing against some 42 students, I decided to start this campaign.  
With this, I plan to help raise awareness of security issues that leave us at risk.  
I plan to repeat this process, using more and less tricky techniques to educate. This first batch was particularly difficult, so please don't feel bad if you fell for it.  

## Further questions/suggestions
If you have any further questions or suggestions, please reach out to me on Slack and we can discuss.
